# Attendify
## About
This project aims to develop an attendance system using facial recognition technology. This application will be built using Flutter for mobile platforms (Android and iOS), and utilizes machine learning for the facial recognition feature.
### Objective
1. Reduces fraud: By using facial recognition, the attendance system becomes more secure and difficult to manipulate.
2. Time efficiency: The attendance process is faster because it only takes a few seconds to recognize a face.
3. Ease of access: Using Flutter allows applications to be used across multiple platforms with a single code base.
